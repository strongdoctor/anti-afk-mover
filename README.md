# anti-afk-mover  
This application just prevents you from getting kicked for being idle. It currently only uses mouse-clicks/holds to move your character around in e.g. Lost Ark.  
  
Just put your cursor somewhere so you'll get jammed into a corner a let it run.  

Press any key besides Alt, Tab, Windows and Enter to stop running application. (It might take a second after pressing a key for it to exit)
